# Qiskit Fall Fest Hackathon â€“ UCLA QCSA

This repository showcases my first experience participating in the **Qiskit Fall Fest Hackathon**, organized by the **UCLA Quantum Computing Student Association (QCSA)**.

During this event, I was introduced to the fundamentals of **Quantum Computing**, including concepts such as **quantum gates**, **circuits**, **noise-reduction techniques**, and the **Qiskit framework**.

## Project Overview

As part of my project, I developed a **Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG)** to demonstrate true randomness and its application in **cryptography**.  
The project features:

- A **quantum-based seed generator**
- Use of fake Qiskit backends to simulate **quantum noise**
- A **basic encryption and decryption algorithm** utilizing the generated random seed  

## Key Learnings

- Introduction to **quantum gates** and **quantum circuit design**  
- Hands-on experience with **Qiskit** for quantum simulation  
- Exploration of **randomness and entropy** in **cryptographic systems**
